Dear detector vendor,

We represent the international NeXus data standard in use at major scientific 
facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America.  
At the X-ray and neutron facilities represented in our community 
we see momentum picking up for moving to HDF5 as a storage container for 
for detector data for many reasons.
One of most frequently mentioned reasons is the efficiency for storing data at high rates 
which is the direction detector to technology is developing in.
Using common, agreed NeXus conventions on top of HDF5 would allow processing, 
reduction and analysis software to work on files from any vendor.
This is a major benefit to the facility users.

As NeXus community, we have been developing a standard for MX raw data in 
NeXus/HDF5 over the last two years. That effort was shared between the scientific 
stakeholders and the company Dectris as an interested partner. This has so far 
been very fruitful for both sides.

The NeXus community and committee feel responsible for any technique at neutron 
or synchrotron light sources and does not wish to be associated exclusively with any
particular vendor. For this reason we are reaching out to you today. We would like you to:

 * consider HDF5 as a data format for future developments
 * when doing so follow NeXus conventions 
 * get in contact with the committee especially if things are unclear or need to be discussed or changed

We are very much interested in continuously developing the NeXus standard as required
by new scientific methods or technologies. We believe any competitive advantage that upcoming 
products may have can be maintained despite using a common data format.

If now or in the future you would like to get in touch about recording data using 
our standard, please contact me or any member of the NIAC.

Kind regards,

NIAC Chair + List of members
