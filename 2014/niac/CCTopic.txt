DONE
----------
* Name clash avoidance         Manual: extensions to base classes:
                                       talk back to NIAC
* NeXus Interfaces             4
* NAPI light, conversion support 7, slim down build of normal NAPI 
* Procedural questions           (procedures still left)
* NXcansas                     8 reviewed
* nexpy       5               DONE, includes spec2NeXus, --> NIAC
* Thumbnail + provenance text storage for OS --> NIAC 
* Design Isues
** Multi file NeXus files       5     DONE: until HDF5 implements virtual datasets
** Associating axes with data   6     DONE --> NIAC 
** Optional content in application definitions  Ratify at NIAC
** Finding default data         Ratify at NIAC
** Storing errors               4     DONE --> NIAC
* Class Issues
** NXmx                         7  --> NIAC
** Review processesed  NXmx      DONE, further email discussion, base class
   	  	       		       + appdef, engage with PDB
*** includes masking
** NXformula                    Ratify at NIAC
** NXfluo                       Forward to NIAC
* Validation tool: reimplement in python, possibly using bits of nexpy, then
  follow up in ANSI-C ananounce as an effort to rewrite
* Lightweight tags: reserve the features array as NXentry,
  NXsubentry as an experimental feature, Mark Basham  and
  Tobias explore this further. Description for NIAC
* sequence_index in NXprocess, NXnote in order to store the sequence
  of operations       --> NIAC
* Contributed definitions       --> ratify/deprecate 
* NXstxm                        --> NIAC


HDF5
--------

* Virtual dataset status
* Ask for experience in setting up standards: funding etc.
* Distribution of 1.8.11
* SWMR: Spring 2016?

DECTRIS
-----------
* Please fix the bugs
* Please drop NXgeometry in favour of the more modern transformation scheme
* Please maintain communication: it is so easy; 2 knowledgeable persons at PSI


NeXus Procedures
-------------------

Priorities:

* Roberts Rule
** The chairman decides the agenda
** The agenda can be challenged and changed

Companies:
* Ask them to engage and become observers

Funding

Possible sources:
* Detector vendors
* Facilities contribution
* Become an ISO standard
* Investigate: hooking into the RDA (research data alliance)
* Investigate: hook into IUCR (they are at least friendly)

Needs Business plan:

* Development of NeXus
** Meetings
** Fund tutorial and dissemination activities
** Do actual development work
*** Maintain the standard
*** Develop tools on community request
*** Assist facilities and DA software writers in implementing NeXus
* We strive for the minimum: we do most our business through email and
  Telcos but a yearly face to  face meeting is necessary

Better Oversight:
* Get user representation
* Invite analysis SW writers


Suggestion
--------------

* More frequent NIAC Telco



Manual Fix
--------

* Drop fast/slow_pixel_size in NXdetector_module, came in with NXmx by accident
